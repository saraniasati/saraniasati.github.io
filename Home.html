        <h1>A little about me</h1>
        <p><span>Welcome to my UX Design portfolio website!</span> I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my
            passion for creating inclusive and accessible digital products with you.</p>
        <p><span>My name is Sara,</span> and I bring a diverse range of interests and experiences to my journey as a UX
            designer.</p>
        <p><span>With a background in cognitive systems,</span> a multidisciplinary program at the University of British
            Columbia that encompasses the study of cognitive systems and their interaction with the environment from
            psychology, computer science, linguistics, and the philosophy perspectives, I have developed a comprehensive
            understanding of human psychology and behavior, as well as the intricate interaction between humans and
            computers. This interdisciplinary foundation has provided me with a holistic approach to UX design, enabling
            me to consider the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of user experiences.</p>
        <p><span>Currently,</span> I am further enhancing my knowledge and skills through my enrollment in the UX Design
            program at BrainStation. This program has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of user experience
            (UX) and user interface (UI) design, providing me with comprehensive learning experiences ranging from
            fundamental principles to hands-on projects.</p>
        <p><span>One of the unique aspects of this program</span> is its remote setting, which has allowed me to develop
            the ability to collaborate effectively in virtual teams. Working on multiple projects, both individually and
            as part of a group, has provided me with valuable practical experience in applying UX/UI design principles
            to real-world scenarios. These hands-on experiences have helped me hone my skills in conducting user
            research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and iterating designs based on user feedback.</p>
        <p>Navigating the remote learning environment has also taught me the importance of clear communication and
            effective collaboration tools. I have gained proficiency in leveraging remote collaboration platforms to
            foster productive teamwork and ensure seamless project execution.</p>
        <p><span>As a designer,</span> I am deeply committed to inclusive design principles. Growing up in the Middle
            East, specifically Iran, I witnessed the struggles people faced when using English-heavy digital products.
            This experience ignited my passion for making language accessible products and finding ways to create
            intuitive interfaces that transcend language barriers. I firmly believe that technology should be inclusive
            and empower individuals from all backgrounds to engage with it effortlessly.</p>
        <p><span>Problem-solving and uncovering patterns</span> in cognitive agent interactions with technology fuel my
            creativity. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of design,
            whether it's through researching user behaviors, conducting usability testing, or prototyping innovative
            solutions.</p>
        <p><span>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits,</span> I find great fulfillment as the host of the
            Farsi-language podcast, Mind Master. This platform allows me to give back to the community in which I was
            born and raised by sharing valuable insights from various multidisciplinary fields and delving into the
            intricacies of the human mind. By podcasting in Farsi, my mother tongue, I can connect with and contribute
            to the Persian-speaking community, fostering a sense of unity and knowledge-sharing. This experience has not
            only allowed me to share my passion and expertise but has also created meaningful connections with
            like-minded individuals, further strengthening the sense of community we share.</p>
        <p><span>In my free time,</span> I indulge in my love for nature and staying active. Hiking, yoga, and
            meditation are activities that provide me with clarity, helping me recharge my energy and stimulate my
            creativity. I am an avid learner, always seeking new styles of self-improvement and personal growth.</p>
        <p><span>I believe in the power of human connection</span> and constantly strive to make a positive impact in
            the world. Through my work as a UX designer, I aim to bridge the gap between people and technology, creating
            meaningful and accessible experiences for all. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I look
            forward to connecting with you and collaborating on exciting projects that shape the future of UX design.
